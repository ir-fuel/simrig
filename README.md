# SIMRIG SR1
How to install the SIMRIG SR1 without turning your rig upside down.

If, like me, you buy the SIMRIG SR1 to install on a rig that's already in use, it's quite a lot of work to disassemble everything and turn the rig upside down. That's why I installed it right side up. Below you can find a guide on how to do this. I have done this on a Sim-Lab TR1, but it should be the same for any 8020 rig.

## Disclaimer

** This way of installing the SIMRIG SR1 is a lot more dangerous than the procedure described in the user manual. If your rig is not correctly supported or you hit it hard while moving around underneath it might lead to serious injury! Proceed at your own risk and be very careful! **

## Required tools
In order to do the installation, besides the tools required for the normal install you will need 4 axle stands that normally are used to support a car in the workshop.
