# SIMRIG SR1
How to install the SIMRIG SR1 without turning your rig upside down.

If, like me, you buy the SIMRIG SR1 to install on a rig that's already in use, it's quite a lot of work to disassemble everything and turn the rig upside down. That's why I installed it right side up. Below you can find a guide on how to do this. I have done this on a Sim-Lab TR1, but it should be the same for any 8020 rig.

## Disclaimer

**This way of installing the SIMRIG SR1 is a lot more dangerous than the procedure described in the user manual. If your rig is not correctly supported or you hit it hard while moving around underneath it might lead to serious injury! Proceed at your own risk and be very careful!**

## Required tools
In order to do the installation, besides the tools required for the normal install you will need 4 axle stands that normally are used to support a car in the workshop.

Putting the rig on the stands and lowering it requires help from a second person.

## Lifting the rig
Since my DD wheel is quite heavy (15kg), the steering wheel would be annoying be while installing the motion platform and it's only 3 bolts, I did remove the steering wheel.

Next I put my rig on the axle stands by first lifting the rear, installing 2 stands at the back, and then lifting the front and installing 2 stands in the middle somewhere. You need 2 people to do this. Attention! I realised later on that I shouldn't have put the back stands so far back. I moved them further forwards as they are interfering with the installation of rear bar. You will see later that I moved them. I suggest to scroll down and see where I put them.

The higher you set it, the easier it will be to work under it. I wouildn't go any lower than what I used.

Once you are done it looks like this

As previously stated, I moved the rear stands forwards in order to install the rear bars. Move them at least 20cm from the back of the rig, so you have room to work.
